# One Minute With Ray O'Hare

### How do people respond to your job title

*“That’s nice. I know nothing about computers.”* [ awkward nodding of heads]



### What gets you out of bed in the morning?

The desire to work on an interesting problem or learn/try something new.



### If you could have any super power, what would you choose and why?

Time Travel. Would be amazing to see where we came from and how we’re going to evolve. What will technology be like in 100 or 1000 years?



### Who in the office is the best at picking the Friday lunch spot?

I have no idea. I’m normally at the gym so not part of the lunch posse.



### What is your top piece of advice for someone looking to get into IT?

I normally hear people say *“I can’t get into IT because I have no experience but I can’t get experience without a job”.* If this applies to you then you need to show you have done what you can to get experience e.g. unpaid work experience, charity work, self-study qualifications or a portfolio.

For development, a portfolio or github page is probably the best way to get noticed. 

Another way is to get a non-IT role with a company and when a vacancy comes up for IT apply for it.

Don’t give up!



### What do you enjoy doing when you are not at work?

I like keeping fit so spend a lot of time at the gym. On weekends I like to go hiking. The more remote the better.



### If a movie of your life were to be made, what would the soundtrack be?

Lord of the Rings. A truly dramatic soundtrack that captures an amazing journey with plenty of ups and downs and adventure. Much like life.



### Knowing what you know now, what advice would you have given yourself on your first day?

Don’t be so nervous and get stuck in.



### Anything you’d like to say to anyone considering working for Protirus?

We have something for everyone. Great colleagues, projects, technology and customers. We expect hard work and high standards but are also very relaxed within the office and there is plenty of fun to be had. Go for it.
