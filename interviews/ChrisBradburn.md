### How do people respond to your job title

“So, you stop people getting hacked?”

Cue agreement and moving onto another subject because it takes ages to explain.

Whatever is needed to get results. Bit of implementation, bit of project management, bit of post-project support. It’s a mixed bag.



### What gets you out of bed in the morning?

Wanting to do the best for my family. This consists of a fiancé and Labrador so far.



### If you could have any super power, what would you choose and why?

Understand and speak any language instantly. How cool would that be.



### Who in the office is the best at picking the Friday lunch spot?

When I do go, which is rare, Alex Duffell does it best. The guy is like yelp for lunch in Newcastle.



### What is your top piece of advice for someone looking to get into IT?

Soft skills cannot be understated. We have the concept of ‘assumed knowledge’ we talk about for candidates to be consultants. This essentially means all the stuff that is NOT technical. We work with some very high-level customers and personalities. Being able to navigate these types of people and situations is invaluable.

But also teach yourself as much tech stuff as possible. It’s OK to ask questions and to get things wrong. Just try as hard as you can, that’s all that can be expected of you.



### What do you enjoy doing when you are not at work?

I’ve been learning guitar the last few months which is great to get away from technology and practice working with your hands. I still suck though.



### If a movie of your life were to be made, what would the soundtrack be?

“Kickapoo” by Tenacious D. Followed by “Grown Up” by Lucy Spraggan.



### Knowing what you know now, what advice would you have given yourself on your first day?

Imposter syndrome is real. It’s more common than you’d think. Remember you were hired for a reason. Relax and focus on learning as much as you can from everyone you work with. You’ve got this, man!



### Anything you’d like to say to anyone considering working for Protirus?

Go for it. It’s good experience and opens the door to a whole host of different futures.
