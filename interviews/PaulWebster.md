#### How do people respond to your job title

Usually with the question… “What is the difference between Delivery and Project Management” ?...

At Protirus, my focus is to ensure that we have the right process and systems in place to effectively manage, monitor and control our Professional Services workloads from Opportunity all the way through to Billing. There’s a number of other functions that sit within that ‘end to end’ path such as Resource, Scheduling and Portfolio Management so it’s more holistic in the sense of a Project Management Office (PMO) rather than singular focus on managing projects

#### What gets you out of bed in the morning?

Back in the day, I used to be a techy
so being presented with a problem to fix always got me out of bed. Even today,
I’m still in that mindset. The problems I solve now are more strategic and
business focused but exist in much the same manner whereby a root cause must be
identified, and a design or workaround implemented to remedy the problem. Helping
people and teams is rewarding, and thankfully I’m no longer on the SLA clock 😊 

<br/>

#### If you could have any super power, what would you choose and why?

To see into the future …. My Planning and Scheduling would never miss a beat 😊

<br/>

#### Who in the office is the best at picking the Friday lunch spot?

That title is certainly up for grabs. The Protirus HQ is centred in the heart of Newcastle and surrounded by tons of pubs. Alan, let’s call for a pub lunch next Friday 😉

<br/>

#### What is your top piece of advice for someone looking to get into IT?

Aim to blend IT certifications with on the job experience. It’s a bit of a chicken and egg concept but if you achieve both it will set up with a solid foundation for years to come.

<br/>

#### What do you enjoy doing when you are not at work?

Travelling. As an expat in a previous life, I’m always on the look out for the next city break and a chance to immerse in a bit of culture. 

<br/>

#### If a movie of your life were to be made, what would the soundtrack be?

That’s a good one. Right now, I’m leaning towards something like the soundtrack from Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, maybe Reservoir Dogs at a push. The wife says she's more gangster than me so maybe those sound tracks are just wishful thinking 😊

<br/>

#### Knowing what you know now, what advice would you have given yourself on your first day?

Open the ears and listen… It’s amazing how much you can learn. Great leaders, coaches and facilitators are usually great listeners.

<br/>

#### Anything you’d like to say to anyone considering working for Protirus?

Absolutely. The journey is just beginning with a very exciting future ahead. At Protirus, you’ll have a chance to play your part in shaping that future.
