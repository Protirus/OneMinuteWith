# One Minute With Andrew Ramsey

### How do people respond to your job title

By saying “oh, that’s *nice*” whilst feigning interest.  

### What gets you out of bed in the morning?

At this point, my body is on autopilot.

### If you could have any super power, what would you choose and why?

The ability to instantly read any book or document without actually reading it, and understand it. Efficiency is underestimated.

### Who in the office is the best at picking the Friday lunch spot?

Me, because I’m biased.

### What is your top piece of advice for someone looking to get into IT?

Start at the bottom and do your time. The “boots on the ground” experience is the best you will ever get. Dealing one-to-one with customers/end users is a vital skill. And being able to contextualise, and compartmentalise their requirements into efficient solutions is the absolute bedrock of a successfully career in IT. 

### What do you enjoy doing when you are not at work?

I play tabletop wargames (Warhammer) somewhat seriously (if there is such a thing), and the odd video game here and now. I’m also big into cars. In the past, I’ve restored cars. However now I’m more of a spectating hobbyist. So I visit car shows etc often. 

### If a movie of your life were to be made, what would the soundtrack be?

Loser – Beck.

### Knowing what you know now, what advice would you have given yourself on your first day?

I think I got off to a good start at Protirus, I can thank Sam and Kev for that. If I had to say something, I’d say to myself, have confidence in what you’re doing. You’re supported by colleagues who are some of the best in the industry, they will put confidence in you, so have some in yourself. 

### Anything you’d like to say to anyone considering working for Protirus?

Not only is the work we do interesting, cutting edge, and something to be immensely proud of, but we’ve got some of the best talent in the industry at Protirus, and the atmosphere is very supportive, and passionate about what we do. If you get the chance, just apply.
