#### How do people respond to your job title

I don’t actually broadcast my job title, I prefer people to take me at face value and how I can help deliver a better Protirus experience.

#### What gets you out of bed in the morning?

Walking the dog, we have a 3year old Working Cocker Spaniel who loves walks along the beach. At the weekend its Park Run on a Saturday, it is a great way to start the day and means you can eat as much as you like for breakfast afterwards.

#### If you could have any super power, what would you choose and why?

Not so much a superpower but I would love to have the transporter from Star Trek that and a Matrix Head Plug that in an instance I can suddenly fly helicopters!

#### Who in the office is the best at picking the Friday lunch spot?

Me – I regularly go for lunch in Newcastle Grainger Market – best Indian Street Food and Pizza slices. The team go out on mass, Nando’s seems to win the popularity steaks.

#### What is your top piece of advice for someone looking to get into IT?

You have to be passionate, passion is the key to success.

<br/>

#### What do you enjoy doing when you are not at work?

Most recently solo wild camping, sounds strange but when all your downtime is taken up around 3 kids, been out on a hillside on your own is such a change of sense and gives a great feeling of wellbeing.

I also have to get in there that I ran the Virgin London Marathon in April 2019 and have just taken up road biking!

<br/>

#### If a movie of your life were to be made, what would the soundtrack be?

Would have to be the sound track to Top Gun, having spent 6 years in the
RAF I will have watched this film so many times, it has great energy. I’m no
maverick but feel I have done some good things and hopefully have plenty of time for more.

<br/>

#### Knowing what you know now, what advice would you have given yourself on your first day?

Be on time, over dress, remember people’s names, be prepared for a steep learning curve.

<br/>

#### Anything you’d like to say to anyone considering working for Protirus?

You will be joining an IT Security practice that if you have ambition can take you to be an onsite consultant delivering projects to some of the largest organization in the world. You will have great training opportunities in the most up to date technologies and you will be joining a great team of likeminded colleagues.
