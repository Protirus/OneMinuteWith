# One Minute With Alan Waggott

### How do people respond to your job title

How long did it take to get your SIA badge



### What gets you out of bed in the morning?

If I’m not rudely awakened by the dustmen, then feeding the pigeons and sometimes the sparrows does, it gives me a sense of enormous well-being.



### If you could have any super power, what would you choose and why?

I’d love to be able to teleport to anywhere in the universe. Imagine the fun you could have, 30 seconds and you’re on mars!!!



### Who in the office is the best at picking the Friday lunch spot?

Usually this is a team effort, but Alexi or Andy, Andy just needs to mention chili loaded fries and I’m there!



### What is your top piece of advice for someone looking to get into IT?

Be keen, be willing to learn, listen and don’t be afraid. Technology is an ever evolving area, find your strengths and use them to become a master in your field of expertise 



### What do you enjoy doing when you are not at work?

Without sounding like too much of a tinder profile, watching a good series on a streaming service of some kind, watching Newcastle (The Biggest team in the north east), and going out with friends to the pub or wherever we all end up! 



### If a movie of your life were to be made, what would the soundtrack be?

Depending on where I am or what and who you speak to it could be any of these 

David Lee Roth – Just like Paradise 

Engelbert Humperdinck – Please release me

Saints of Arcadia – Rain (I spend a lot of time look out of train windows) 

Whitesnake – Wine, Women, Song

They all pretty much some me up in a week! 



### Knowing what you know now, what advice would you have given yourself on your first day?

I would have made sure I had a pen and notepad so I could write all the really good information down for our Wiki, it’s a fountain of knowledge!
