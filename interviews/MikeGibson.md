#### How do people respond to your job title

I rarely reveal it.

<br/>

#### What gets you out of bed in the morning?

My children and a passion to get on with the success of Protirus.

<br/>

#### If you could have any super power, what would you choose and why?

The ability to fly. I’ve spent enough time sat in airports these last few years.

<br/>

#### Who in the office is the best at picking the Friday lunch spot?

Ah, the legendary Friday lunch. No idea, I’m a solitary runner at lunchtime.

<br/>

#### What is your top piece of advice for someone looking to get into IT?

The best consultants have done their time. Don’t knock entry level, if you work hard behind the scenes, you soon advance.

<br/>

#### What do you enjoy doing when you are not at work?

Running. Playing by the sea on the beach or in the skatepark with my kids.

<br/>

#### If a movie of your life were to be made, what would the soundtrack be?

Beastie Boys -> Happy Mondays -> Rachmaninoff -> EDM -> Any Indy **BUT** Oasis -> Anything played on ZZZ -> An unhealthy addiction to Spotify peppered with Disney played at some
un-holy speed.

<br/>

#### Knowing what you know now, what advice would you have given yourself on your first day?

None, I would ignore my older self and do it my way regardless.
