# One Minute With Jessica Beardsworth



### What is your job role at Protirus?

This month we are chatting to Jess, HR Services Manager at Protirus

<br/>



### How do people respond to your job title

People always look puzzled as to what it means, but no one ever asks. 

<br/>



### What gets you out of bed in the morning?

A gazillion alarms & coffee; I’d like to be able to say something more inspiring and uplifting but I can’t, I am a terrible morning person.

<br/>



### If you could have any super power, what would you choose and why?

Being in more than one place at a time; growing up abroad; I have a lot of friends and family around the world that I would love to be able to see more of.

<br/>



### Who in the office is the best at picking the Friday lunch spot?

Definitely not me, I’ve got myself a bit of a reputation for ditching out of the Friday lunches (ask Alexi) but I promise its not on purpose! 

The Devs, they always know the best places.

<br/>



### What is your top piece of advice for someone looking to get into IT?

You can always build on experience; so make sure you put yourself out there and take every opportunity that comes your way.

<br/>



### What do you enjoy doing when you are not at work?

Spending time with friends and family, travelling, going to the beach, live music, and occasionally the cinema (when I’ve run out of binge-worthy documentaries on Netflix). 

<br/>



### If a movie of your life were to be made, what would the soundtrack be?

Something daft like Spice Up Your Life – Spice Girls.

<br/>



### Knowing what you know now, what advice would you have given yourself on your first day?

Be yourself, the tough part is done; you’ve passed the interview and been offered the job so now so try to not let the nerves get the better of you.

<br/>
