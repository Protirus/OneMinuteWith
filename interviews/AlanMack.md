### How do people respond to your job title

“So what does that mean.” “Can you fix my PC?” Once people figure out you work in IT, they feel the need to tell you about their computer issues. No, I don't know why your computer is opening slowly, or why your PlayStation is making a weird noise. 



### What gets you out of bed in the morning?

Alexa and “Planet Rock Radio”. It takes a lot to get me out of bed, but hard rock does it. I'm not a morning person so coffee and croissants help.



### If you could have any super power, what would you choose and why?

To be able to instantly transport to any place instantly. The whole world would only be a step away. I'd go straight to Mount Everest (while holding my breath). I'd snap a few pictures and tell people I took a year out but didn't want to brag about it. 



### Who in the office is the best at picking the Friday lunch spot?

You just got to follow the Dev team… It’s mandatory. Subway wins though. I'm a sucker for a points system. I went for a haircut last Saturday in Newcastle and the woman in Subway recognised me!



### What is your top piece of advice for someone looking to get into IT?

It is such a broad field so get a solid grounding across all the main areas then really look at what you enjoy and focus on that. I originally wanted to do Pharmacology but switched to Computer Science. I started at Unilever many years ago running around repairing PCs with a box of spare parts. Over the years I dabbled in all areas which has helped me so much today.



### What do you enjoy doing when you are not at work?

Playing guitar, gym and relaxing. The working world today is too fast not to take a break. And yes, I can play Stairway to Heaven.



### If a movie of your life were to be made, what would the soundtrack be?

The album ‘The Elder’ by Kiss with various Steve Vai tracks injected for dramatic effect



### Knowing what you know now, what advice would you have given yourself on your first day?

Take your time as you can’t be 100% on everything on day one
