### How do people respond to your job title

It’s quite a lengthy title so I used to just say I was a Security Consultant, but then I got asked if that was Physical Security or IT Security, I’d let them guess which one I’m built for. 



### What gets you out of bed in the morning?

In order; the dog, good coffee, breakfast, my day packed full of challenge and reward.



### If you could have any super power, what would you choose and why?

Time Travel. I love history, and to be able to live and experience past times would be incredible.



### Who in the office is the best at picking the Friday lunch spot?

I think I find the best new places to try, but picking which one we go to is Alex’s responsibility. 



### What is your top piece of advice for someone looking to get into IT?

Build a solid foundation of general IT knowledge, and then pair that with hard work, determination and willingness to learn. Demonstrate those skills in any role and with time you will be successful. 



### What do you enjoy doing when you are not at work?

I’m very hobby orientated and enjoy watching films, tv series, gaming, beer, Warhammer, hiking and photography. 
 I’ve also got a miniature dachshund called Brie, and she gets a lot of the attention in my free time. 



### If a movie of your life were to be made, what would the soundtrack be?

12-14 : Naive - The Kooks
14-16 : Space Jam - Quad City DJ’s
16-18 : Got Some Teeth - Obie Trice
18-21 : Discolights - Darren Styles
 21+ : Ready to Start - Arcade Fire



### Knowing what you know now, what advice would you have given yourself on your first day?

Listen well, get involved, be prepared to use the skills you’ve got. 
Reminder: Don’t make friends with the guy that wears a Newcastle shirt.



### Anything you’d like to say to anyone considering working for Protirus?

We have high expectations and expect hard work, but in return we have some of the best colleagues, customers and opportunities of any IT Security company. 

Also, the office is situated beside two pubs.
