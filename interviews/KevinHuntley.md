#### How do people respond to your job title

I once had a compere at a comedy gig fall asleep when I told him what I do for a living…My wife introduces me as the man with the Chandler Bing Job. So not great to be honest.

<br/>

#### What gets you out of bed in the morning?

My daughter as she’s the first up and likes to play dollies first thing in the morning. That, and my to-do list, it’s typically fully of challenging tasks that gets my brain ticking over as soon as I’m up (and not playing dollies). 

<br/>

#### If you could have any super power, what would you choose and why?

The Force, that’s a super power in my opinion. It’s late and the remote is on the other couch? Force pull it over! Want to stop a Bank Robbery? Use the Force! Itchy back? Use the Force! You see where I’m going with this. Also, not a fan of underwear over the trousers.

<br/>

#### Who in the office is the best at picking the Friday lunch spot?

Not Alex H - sorry Alex, there’s only so much Nando’s a man can have, even if it is “Cheeky”. Probably Sam because he’s young and hip.

<br/>

#### What is your top piece of advice for someone looking to get into IT?

Be the best [Job Role] you can be, if you’re a helpdesk analyst, be the best, if a junior consultant be the best. Where you start isn’t where you’ll finish in IT. Get noticed, ask to try out stuff that interests you. Be Keen.

<br/>

#### What do you enjoy doing when you are not at work?

Warning, the following section is very nerdy.

<br/>

When not spending time with my family at the beach, local park, playing hide and seek, dollies, playing doctor, reading bed time stories or swimming on a Sunday morning with my daughter then I’m battling hordes of monsters with Warhammer (with some people from Protirus, but I won’t name names), collecting vintage Sci-fi comics / novellas – (Tip: charity shops are great for this), reading Sci-Fi\Fantasy\Popular Science books and a little bit of gaming. I also love low-budget sci-fi movies.


<br/>

#### If a movie of your life were to be made, what would the soundtrack be?

**Scene**: Montage of me growing up

<br/>

**Sound Track**: From the ages 0-11 it would be the Carpenters, The Commodores and Jive Bunny. 11 – 18 would be Linkin Park, Papa Roach, Nickleback (don’t judge!), Joe Satriani, Lionel Ritchie. 18 – 32 much of the same, but classical piano, Daft Punk, and the LOTR sound track. From 33 it would the Bing theme tune, Mr Tumble, the wheels on the bus, blaze and the monster machines, postman pat and the paw patrol theme, also MegaDeath (late discovery).

<br/>

*Editorial note, Kev was the one who spelt Megadeth, MegaDeath.*

#### Knowing what you know now, what advice would you have given yourself on your first day?

Talk Slower, Be Braver.
