### How do people respond to your job title

With a bemused smile because they don’t understand what I do

Since I have ‘2’ job titles… They react to the first with a bemused smile, either they don’t understand what it is or think I’m a massive nerd. The second has only been commented on by my friends, they think it’s some millennial joke 🤷.



### What gets you out of bed in the morning?

Obviously it’s the Tour De Newcastle. I cycle to work and make it my goal to chase Strava KOM’s, spin up hills (viva la washing machine) & smoke any other cycling commuter in sight!  ⛰️🚴‍♂️



### If you could have any super power, what would you choose and why?

The ability to learn anything incredibly quickly, to an elite standard. I’d become some sort of crackpot philanthropist who founded the first heavy metal, cycling tech company that people worship on social media & builds some sick tech that revolutionises society again.

*Although maybe I should try and do that anyway…* 🤔



### Who in the office is the best at picking the Friday lunch spot?

Everyone says themselves, so I’ve got to say myself. Lunch is usually just choosing a place that Alex H will actually eat at, but when I get free reign you know it’s going to be delicious 😋🤤 Five Guys, Meat Stack, Byron…. You had me at lunch!



### What is your top piece of advice for someone looking to get into IT?

I’ll keep this advice more on the development side:

- **Don’t read about it, do it**
   Somethings are complicated and reading about them only gives you a small glimpse of the picture. If you really want to learn something, build something that uses it. For example I want to learn more about Kubernetes & Microserviced Applications, so I’m building a very serious (completely novel) site that displays words that I’ve found in guids. This site is complete overkill and is being designed to scale & operate on a commercial scale. This is all to give me the hands on experience of working with Kubernetes, the workflow and all of the pitfalls that inevitably come along when working with an unfamiliar piece of technology

- **Maintain online visibility (ie open source contributions)**
   Get a GitHub account and start a blog, twitter is optional (I hate it, however it is great for networking with other devs). Make some sample projects, find ways to host them (such as GitHub Docs). Write about your experience working on a project. If you encounter an issue that is not/poorly documented online, write a blog about how to do this. Other devs & employers alike will appreciate your contributions to open source, it demonstrates competence & a strong work ethic. 

- **Read other developers socials**
   When you are working on a particular technology, find developers who blog & create libraries of that technology. My example is Xamarin (which is my favourite platform to develop), developers such as: James Montemagno, Frank Krueger, Brian Lagunas, Daniel Siegel, Charlin Agramonte (XamGirl) and many more are a fountain of knowledge that should not be underestimated. When it comes to apps, these people have already done the heavy lifting and have most likely blogged about it. Many of them are now doing livestreams where you can watch & interact with them as they develop.

- **Stay humble**
   You’re always a student in this industry, no matter your experience. Due to the nature of IT you can’t know everything, you’re entitled to your specialism of course but always be open to learning from others. We all have something to learn from each others development journeys, keep and open mind and you’ll go very far (not to mention make plenty of friends).

- **Enjoy yourself**
   You can’t work at something you don’t enjoy, find an area that you genuinely enjoy and feel you can make a contribution to and work hard to make that your full time job. Whether its apps, websites, games, cyber security or consulting, enjoy & respect your craft and success will follow!



### What do you enjoy doing when you are not at work?

First and foremost I love music. Spotify called me “Genre Fluid” but my main genres are Metal, Pop Punk, Hip Hop, Rock, Pop, Anything else in that order. I play guitar & drums and spend plenty of time recording & producing heavy music. 🎸

I also love cycling, whether it’s a group ride, solo trek or the commute. In 2020 I aim to ride 4000 miles and hope to travel to mainland Europe to tackle some more iconic routes (probably in France). 🚴‍♂️

I guess I also spend a bit of time playing videogames… 🤫 yeah only a little 🙈 I took League of Legends once in 2012 and I’m still addicted now. I’m a hard stuck Diamond 4, but I do like taking clash way too seriously and following the LEC & Global LOL scene (👏👏👏 LETS GO G2 👏👏👏)



### If a movie of your life were to be made, what would the soundtrack be?

**The Fires Of Ancient Cosmic Destiny** by **Gloryhammer**



### Knowing what you know now, what advice would you have given yourself on your first day?

- Be confident in your own abilities

- Don’t be afraid to voice your own opinion

- Humour Alex H when he starts showing you his Twitter DM’s & starts explaining a story without introducing the people in it. “Yeah I know who tim is! 😄……..”
