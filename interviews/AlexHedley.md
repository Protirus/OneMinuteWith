### How do people respond to your job title

Is your computer screen at work like the matrix?

### What gets you out of bed in the morning?

Apart from breakfast, the love of a challenge, and each day is always different. What conundrum do I need to solve today?

### If you could have any super power, what would you choose and why?

To stop time so I can complete more side projects, and read more books, the library grows but the days don't get longer :p

### Who in the office is the best at picking the Friday lunch spot?

Me, naturally, Nandos used to be the winner until they removed the spiciest of spices, mango and lime, but you can't go wrong with a Kracklin.

### What is your top piece of advice for someone looking to get into IT?

Contribute to Open Source projects, it's a great way to get to know the community you'll likely be dealing with. Give back and learn how others work; teamwork is key.

### What do you enjoy doing when you are not at work?

I love going to the movies, it's an escape from reality and somewhere I can sit back and relax.

### If a movie of your life were to be made, what would the soundtrack be?

Anything by Peter Gabriel.

### Knowing what you know now, what advice would you have given yourself on your first day?

Bring a smile and enjoy yourself.

### Anything youâ€™d like to say to anyone considering working for Protirus?

Have a willingness to learn at every opportunity, technology moves so quickly and you never know what you'll be working on from one day to the next.... and you'll need to participate in Waistcoat Wednesdays.
